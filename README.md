#### ABSTRACT

Information is mounting significantly and hungry for knowledge. As data is expanding, the world is moving in chasing information with the assistance of analytics in this era of Big Data. The flooding of information arising out of different areas is named for automated learning techniques for data analysis, which is implied as Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Linear Regression is a statistical strategy for plotting the line and is used for predictive analysis. Gradient descent is the cycle that uses a cost function on gradients for limiting the complexity in computing mean square error. The above-mentioned methods are implemented in the project using python programming tools for analyzing the datasets.

*Keywords: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Linear Regression, Predictive Analysis, Gradient descent, Cost Function*

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT

To propose a “Mathematical Model for Linear Data” comparing the accuracy of the model with the existing linear fitting function.

#### Dataset: ***Communities and Crime Data Set***

Communities within the United States. The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.
